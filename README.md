# GUI Term Project
This repository represents the 3 month project for the Graphical User Interface(CST 238) class taught at the Oregon Institute of Technology by David Bishop, [Stewart Taylor](https://github.com/StewartTaylor), [Jacob Neal](https://github.com/jacobneal), and [Christopher Daen](https://github.com/Tpimp).

# Description: 
Cross platform notecard making and studying application **Study Smart** aims at making studying and quizing yourself on any device easier. This cross plateform application works on iOS, Android and all major desktop platforms *(Windows, OSX, Linux)*. Built entirely from scratch using C++ and the Qt framework. :fire:

The goal of this application is to help anyone see improvements in their ability to memorize whatever they need to and do better in school :memo: work :bar_chart: or for whatever the future holds :crystal_ball:

# Project logo:
Below is a little bit of what the proposed logo would look like. To get the full effect, it shows what the icon would look like on the app store, on the homescreen, and if it were going to be streched to several diffenent sizes (iPad resolution versus iPhone).

# Screenshots: 
Wireframe of UI: 
![alt tag](https://github.com/maurerpower12/GUI/blob/master/Study%20Smart%20StoryBoard.jpg)
As you can see above the UI for the app is going to be broken down into a couple of screens.


Far Left Screen | Middle Screen | Right Screen | Landscape Screen
------------ | -------------
The far left screen shows what the user would see when they first login. You can sort the note cards by Label, Front or Back. |  The main screen is the one in the middle that allows the user to enter questions and answers for each notecard. | The far right screen shows an exmple of a note card that contains an image. | The sideways view at the bottom shows how the user can press if they got the card right or wrong.

# Credits, Inspiration, Alternatives
Credit for this idea goes to Ryan Williams! He had the idea of making a simple note card app. With his blessing I took on this as my project idea. Also credit needs to go to Ashley Wagner, Coryna Johnson, Eliza Henderson, Jared Smith and Stephen Alspach for all of us brainstorming ideas for projects together in lab. 

There are plenty of apps like this one avaible on the market. Similar apps include Study Blue and Quizlet. These apps aren't solely devoted to note card making, but do include this element.
